# vesper-accounts
This was the account management website for Vesper, an iOS note-taking app by Q Branch.

This is not a living project. It’s a historical artifact: it’s the Node.js website that ran at https://accounts.vesperapp.co/, which was taken down when Vesper syncing was turned off.

I don’t claim that this represents the right way or wrong way to write a Node app or do an account-management website. But whatever you may learn from it — good ideas, things to avoid, whatever — is totally cool. That’s why it’s here.

The one and only change from the actual shipping version was a line that imported a web font. Otherwise it’s entirely as it was on the server. (Which was a Node server running on Azure.)

More notes will be forthcoming.
